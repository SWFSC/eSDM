\title{Create polygons from centroid coordinates}
\usage{
pts2poly_centroids(x, y, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data frame with at least two columns;
the first two columns must contain longitude and latitude coordinates, respectively.
See 'Details' section for how additional columns are handled}

\item{y}{numeric; shortest distance from centroid to any of the sides
(i.e. half the length of one side of a polygon)}

\item{...}{passed to \link[sf:sf]{st_sf} or to \link[sf:sfc]{st_sfc},
e.g. for passing named arguments \code{crs} and \code{agr}}
}
\value{
Object of class \code{sfc} (if \code{x} has exactly two columns) or class \code{sf}
  (if \code{x} has exactly more than two columns). The object will have a geometry type of \code{POLYGON}.
  If the object is of class \code{sf}, the name of the geometry list-column will be "geometry"
}
\description{
Create polygon(s) from a data frame with coordinates of the polygon centroid(s)
}
\details{
This function was designed for someone who reads in a .csv file
  with a grid of coordinates representing SDM prediction points and needs to create
  prediction polygons with the .csv file coordinates as the polygon centroids.
  However, the function can be used to create square polygons of any size around the provided points,
  regardless of if those polygons touch or overlap.
  The created polygons are oriented so that, in a 2D plane, their edges are parallel to either the x or the y axis.

  If \code{x} contains more than two column, then additional columns will be treated as simple feature attributes,
  i.e. passed along as the first argument to \link[sf:sf]{st_sf}

  If a \code{crs} is not specified in \code{...},
  then the \code{crs} attribute of the polygon(s) will be \code{NULL}.

# Create an sfc object from a data frame of two columns
x <- data.frame(
  lon = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 5, 10, 15, 20),
  lat = c(5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10)
)
pts2poly_centroids(x, 2.5, crs = 4326)

# Create an sf object from a data frame of more than two columns
x <- data.frame(
  lon = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 5, 10, 15, 20),
  lat = c(5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10),
  sdm.pred = runif(8),
  sdm.pred2 = runif(8)
