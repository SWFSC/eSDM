\title{Sample SDM density predictions}
\format{Objects of class \code{sf} with a column of density predictions (name: \code{Density}) and
  a simple feature list column (name: \code{geometry}).
  \code{preds.1} also has a second column of sample density predictions (name: \code{Density2})}
\usage{
preds.1

preds.2

preds.3
}
\description{
\code{preds.1}, \code{preds.2}, and \code{preds.3} are objects of class \code{\link[sf]{sf}} that serve as
  sample sets of SDM density predictions for the \code{eSDM} package
}
\details{
\code{preds.1} sample SDM density predictions created by importing
  Sample_predictions_2.csv into the eSDM GUI, exporting predictions, and then
  clipping them to the SoCal_bite.csv region

\code{preds.2} sample SDM density predictions created by importing
  Sample_predictions_1.csv into the eSDM GUI, exporting predictions, and then
  clipping them to the SoCal_bite.csv region

\code{preds.3} is a set of sample SDM density predictions created by importing
  Sample_predictions_4_gdb into the eSDM GUI, exporting predictions, and then
  clipping them to the SoCal_bite.csv region
